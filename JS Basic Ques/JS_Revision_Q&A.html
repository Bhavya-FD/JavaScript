                <p><b>History:-</b> Brendan Eich created JavaScript in 1995, originally designed for Netscape 2. 
                    It later became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. Following Netscape's transfer 
                    of JavaScript to ECMA, the Mozilla Foundation took over its development for 
                    the Firefox browser, with the latest version being 1.8.5. <br>
                <b>Significance of JS:-</b>JavaScript (JS) is a cross-platform, 
                object-oriented programming language used by developers to make web pages interactive. 
                It allows developers to create dynamically updating content, use animations, pop-up menus, 
                clickable buttons, control multimedia, etc.

              <blockquote class="blockquote mb-0">
                <p>The fundamentals of JavaScript are the building blocks of the language. 
                    These include variables, data types, control structures, functions, and objects. 
                    Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for anyone looking to become proficient 
                    in JavaScript programming.</p>

              <blockquote class="blockquote mb-0">
                <p>The syntax of JavaScript is the set of rules defining valid programming statements. 
                    Javascript's syntax is similar to C and Java: it is case-sensitive, statements end with 
                    semicolons, and curly braces are used to mark blocks of code.</p>

            <div class="card-header bg-success text-light">Q.4. How does JavaScript differ from other programming languages?</div>
            <div class="card-body">
              <blockquote class="blockquote mb-0">
                <p>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language. This means that code written in 
                    JavaScript is made up of objects that contain data and functions. These objects can be 
                    manipulated and used to create complex programs.Most programming languages are compiled, 
                    meaning that the code must be compiled into machine code before it can be run. 
                    On the other hand, JavaScript is an interpreted language, meaning that it does not need 
                    to be compiled before it can be run. This makes JavaScript easier to work with.</p>

              <blockquote class="blockquote mb-0">
                <p>1. Clean code is a term used to describe computer code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. 
                    Clean code is written in a way that makes it simple, concise, and expressive. <br>
                    2. Clean coding means that in the first place you write code for your later self and for your co-workers and not for the machine. <br>
                    3. Use intention-revealing names and don't worry if you have long variable names. <br>
                    4. Using consistent formatting and syntax throughout a codebase is an important aspect of writing clean code.
