    <h1>JavaScript Operators</h1>
    <p>&bullet; JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands.</p>
    <p>There are following types of operators in JavaScript.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
        <li>Comparison (Relational) Operators</li>
        <li>Bitwise Operators</li>
        <li>Logical Operators</li>
        <li>Assignment Operators</li>
        <li>Special Operators</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>1.Arithmetic Operators:</h2>
    <p>Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on the operands.
        <br>The following operators are known as JavaScript arithmetic operators.</p>
    <pre>
        +	    Addition	                10+20 = 30
        -	    Subtraction	                20-10 = 10
        *	    Multiplication	        10*20 = 200
        /	    Division	                20/10 = 2
        %	    Modulus (Remainder)	        20%10 = 0
        ++	    Increment	                var a=10; a++; Now a = 11
        --	    Decrement	                var a=10; a--; Now a = 9
    </pre>

    <h2>2.Comparison (Relational) Operators:</h2>
    <p>The JavaScript comparison operator compares the two operands. <br>
        The comparison operators are as follows:</p>
    <pre>
        ==	        Is equal to	                        10==20 = false
        ===	        Identical (equal & of same type)	10==20 = false
        !=	        Not equal to	                        10!=20 = true
        !==	        Not Identical	                        20!==20 = false
        >	        Greater than	                        20>10 = true
        >=	        Greater than or equal to	        20>=10 = true
        &lt;	        Less than	                        20&lt;10 = false
        &lt;=	        Less than or equal to	                20&lt;=10 = false
    </pre>
    <h2>3.Bitwise Operators</h2>
    <p>The bitwise operators perform bitwise operations on operands. <br> The bitwise operators are as follows:</p>
    <pre>
        &	        Bitwise AND	                     (10==20 & 20==33) = false
        |       	Bitwise OR	                     (10==20 | 20==33) = false
        ^	        Bitwise XOR	                     (10==20 ^ 20==33) = false
        ~       	Bitwise NOT	                     (~10) = -10
        &lt;&lt;	        Bitwise Left Shift	             (10&lt;&lt;2) = 40
        >>	        Bitwise Right Shift	             (10>>2) = 2
        >>>     	Bitwise Right Shift with Zero	     (10>>>2) = 2
    </pre>
    <h2>4.Logical Operators</h2>
    <p>The following operators are known as JavaScript logical operators.</p>
    <pre>
        &&	        Logical AND	                (10==20 && 20==33) = false
        ||	        Logical OR	                (10==20 || 20==33) = false
        !	        Logical Not	                !(10==20) = true
    </pre>
    <h2>5.Assignment Operators</h2>
    <p>The following operators are known as JavaScript assignment operators.</p>
    <pre>
        =	        Assign	                        10+10 = 20
        +=	        Add and assign	                var a=10; a+=20;    Now a = 30
        -=	        Subtract and assign var         a=20; a-=10;        Now a = 10
        *=	        Multiply and assign var         a=10; a*=20;        Now a = 200
        /=	        Divide and assign var           a=10; a/=2;         Now a = 5
        %=	        Modulus and assign var          a=10; a%=2;         Now a = 0
    </pre>
    <h2>6.Special Operators</h2>
    <p>The following operators are known as JavaScript special operators.</p>
    <pre>
        (?:)	            Conditional Operator returns value based on the condition. It is like if-else.
        ,	            Comma Operator allows multiple expressions to be evaluated as single statement.
        delete	            Delete Operator deletes a property from the object.
        in	            In Operator checks if object has the given property
        instanceof	    checks if the object is an instance of given type
        new	            creates an instance (object)
        typeof	            checks the type of object.
        void	            it discards the expression's return value.
        yield	            checks what is returned in a generator by the generator's iterator.
    </pre>

        let b=20;               //we have assigned a value 20 to b
        console.log(a+b);       //a and b are added
        console.log(a-b);       //subtraction of a and b
        console.log(a*b);       //multiplication of a and b

        //post-increment of a variable
        let c=10;
        console.log(c++);       //log will remain 10 because it is a post-increment.value will be increase later
        console.log(c);         //so here it will be 11

        //pre-increment of a variable
        let d=20;
        console.log(++d);       //log will be 21 because increment has already happened.

        //post-decrement of a variable
        let e=30;
        console.log(e--);       //log will remain 30 because it is post-decrement.value will be decrease later
        console.log(e);         //so here it will be 29

        //pre-decrement of a variable
        let f=40;
        console.log(--f);       //log will be 39 because decrement has already happened.


        // let a=10;
        // console.log(a++);       ==> post-Increment
        // console.log(++a);       ==> pre-Increment
        // console.log(a--);       ==> post-Decrement
        // console.log(--a);       ==> pre-Decrement
