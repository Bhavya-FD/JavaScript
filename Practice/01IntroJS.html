    <h1>Introduction to JS</h1>
    <h2>What is JS</h2>
    <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.</p>
    <p>JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language
        which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, <br>
        full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites 
        when applied to an HTML document.</p>
    <h2>Features of JavaScript</h2>
    <h3>There are following features of JavaScript:</h3>   
    <ul>
        <li>It is a case-sensitive language.</li>
        <li>It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.</li>
        <li>JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language.
            Thus, it is a structured programming language.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that 
            uses prototypes rather than using classes for inheritance.</li>
    </ul> 
    <h2>Ways to Apply</h2>
    <p>Javascript example is easy to code. JavaScript provides 3 places to put the <br>
        JavaScript code: within body tag, within head tag and external JavaScript file.</p>
    <h2>Comments</h2>
    <p>Comments are written using double slash(//) in JS.</p>
    <h3>Types of JavaScript Comments</h3>
    <h4>There are two types of comments in JavaScript:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Single-line Comment</li>
        <li>Multi-line Comment</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>1. JavaScript Single line Comment</h3>
    <p>It is represented by double forward slashes (//). It can be used before and after the statement.</p>
        <p>// It is single line comment</p>
    <h3>2. JavaScript Multi line Comment</h3>
    <p>It can be used to add single as well as multi line comments. So, it is more convenient. <br>
        It is represented by forward slash with asterisk then asterisk with forward slash.</p>
    <p>/* It is multi line comment.*/</p>  
    
    <script>
        alert("Hello World")
        // Comments are written using double slash in JS.
    </script>
</body>
