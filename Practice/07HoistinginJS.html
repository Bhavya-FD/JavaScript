    <h1>Hoisting in JS</h1>
    <p>&bull; JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears
        to move the declaration of functions, variables, classes, or imports to the
        top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.</p>
    <p>&bull; It allows us to call functions before even writing them in our code.</p>
    <p>&bull; JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.</p>
    <p>&bull; Sequence of variable declaration: The following is the sequence in which
        variable declaration and initialization occur. </p>
    <pre>
        let/const a;           // Declaration
        a = 100;              // Assignment
        console.log(a);      // Usage
    </pre>
    <p>While using var its different</p>
    <pre>
        a= 10;              //Assignment
        console.log(a);    //Usage
        var a;            //Declaration
    </pre>
    <h2>Host</h2>
    <p>&bull; A host is a device connected to the Internet (or a local network). 
        Some hosts called servers offer additional services like serving webpages or 
        storing files and emails.</p>
        
    <script>
        let a;                 // Declaration
        a = 100;              // Assignment
        console.log(a);      // Usage
        
    //While using var its different

        b= 10;              //Assignment
        console.log(b);    //Usage
        var b;            //Declaration
